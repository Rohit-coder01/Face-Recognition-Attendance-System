Face Recognition Attendance System ✅

Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System! 🎉 This project leverages Machine Learning & OpenCV to mark attendance automatically using facial recognition. 📸✨

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time Face Detection – Uses OpenCV's Haarcascade classifier. 🕵️‍♂️
✅ Face Recognition with KNN – Identifies individuals from a trained dataset. 🤖
✅ Automated Attendance Logging – Stores attendance in CSV files. 📜
✅ Speech Feedback – Announces when attendance is marked. 🔊
✅ Streamlit Web App Support – A user-friendly interface for easy interaction. 🌐
✅ Customizable Webcam Overlay – Adjust webcam feed placement on the UI. 🎨

🛠 How It Works

1️⃣ Load Data – Pre-saved facial features & labels are loaded from data/ folder. 📂
2️⃣ Detect Faces – Uses OpenCV to detect faces from the webcam feed. 📷
3️⃣ Recognize Faces – KNN classifier predicts the identity of detected faces. 🧐
4️⃣ Mark Attendance – If recognized, logs the name & timestamp into a CSV file. 📊
5️⃣ Voice Confirmation – The system announces that attendance is taken. 🎙️# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
